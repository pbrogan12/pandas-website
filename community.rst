History of Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 2008, *pandas* development began at `AQR Capital Management
<http://www.aqr.com>`_. By the end of 2009 it had been `open sourced
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source>`_, and is actively supported today
by a community of like-minded individuals around the world who
contribute their valuable time and energy to help make open source *pandas*
possible. Thank you to `all of our contributors
<https://github.com/pydata/pandas/contributors>`_.

Since 2015, *pandas* is a `NumFOCUS <http://www.numfocus.org/open-source-projects.html>`__ sponsored project. This will help ensure the success of development of *pandas* as a world-class open-source project.
